Usage
-----

1. Insert my plugin to plugin folder on you server
2. Then follow commands after using "/racing" commands
3. You need to setup arena and spawn points. 
4. There is also possible to set up Power-ups for you horse
5. The main reason for this plugin is to be able to create horse racings with boosts and checkpoints
6. I didnt have enough time to create arena saving but basicly the main structure of my plugin works.

I am sorry for my english. But when I am in stress it's worse and worse :-)
